The Chemtech Codex is a simple CLI-based calculator that solves and integrates General Chemistry 2 concepts. It takes inputs from the user and uses predetermined formulas to calculate values. The following General Chemistry 2 topics are covered:

1. **Thermochemistry**

    Standard Enthalpy, Standard Entropy Change / System Entropy, Entropy of The Surroundings, and Entropy of The Universe.

2. **Chemical Kinetics**

    First Order Reactions.

3. **Chemical Equilibrium**

    Chemical Equilibrium Constants Using Molarities and Pressures.

4. **Acids and Bases**

    Potential of hydrogen ions and potential of hydroxide ions.

*This repository does not follow conventional commit messages because it was made solely for academic purposes.*
